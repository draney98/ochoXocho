# AI Prompt for Sound Recommendations

Copy and paste this prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, or another public AI to get sound recommendations:

---

I'm developing a block placement puzzle game (similar to Tetris but with different mechanics). I need free, open-source sound effects that I can use commercially. Please search the following free sound libraries and recommend specific sounds with direct download links:

**Sound Libraries to Search:**
- Freesound.org (CC0 or public domain preferred)
- OpenGameArt.org (CC0 or CC-BY licenses)
- Kenney.nl (CC0 license)
- Mixkit.co (Mixkit License - free for commercial use)

**Sounds I Need:**

1. **Place Sound** - A short, satisfying sound when a block shape is placed on the game board (duration: ~0.1-0.2 seconds)
   - Should be pleasant and confirmatory
   - Like a click, plop, or gentle chime

2. **Clear Sound** - A brief, positive sound when a line or column is cleared (duration: ~0.15-0.25 seconds)
   - Should feel rewarding and successful
   - Like a chime, ding, or success tone

3. **Board Cleared Sound** - A longer, more celebratory sound when the entire board is cleared (duration: ~0.3-0.5 seconds)
   - Should be more impressive than the regular clear sound
   - Like a fanfare, victory chime, or success melody

4. **Game Over Sound** - A somber or final sound when the game ends (duration: ~0.4-0.6 seconds)
   - Should indicate failure/end of game
   - Like a low tone, failure sound, or descending note

5. **Pop Sound** - A very short, sharp sound for block explosions/pops (duration: ~0.05-0.1 seconds)
   - Should be quick and punchy
   - Like a pop, click, or short burst

**Requirements:**
- All sounds must be free for commercial use (CC0, public domain, or permissive licenses)
- MP3, OGG, or WAV format preferred
- Sounds should be clean and not too harsh
- Please provide:
  - Direct download links to each recommended sound
  - The license type for each sound
  - A brief description of why each sound fits the use case
  - Alternative suggestions if the first choice isn't available

**Game Style:**
The game has a modern, clean aesthetic with colorful blocks. The sounds should complement this style - not too retro/8-bit, but also not overly complex. Simple, clean, and satisfying is the goal.

Please search these libraries and provide specific recommendations with working download links.
